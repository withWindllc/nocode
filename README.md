# No Code

No code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications. Write nothing; deploy nowhere.

## Getting Started

Start by not writing any code.

```

code ‚Äìless. action ‚Äìless. site ‚Äìless. audience ‚Äìless. 

```

This is just an example application, but imagine it doing anything you want. Adding new features is easy too:

```
yet... Top 5k Crunchbase rank & Top 50k organizational profile. 

```

[don't believe me?](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/c-brennan-poole "point-of-fact, i'm a bit a proficient conscientious growth-hack") [have a looksee](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chasing-the-wind-llc "simply put, with Wind does not lie.")

The possibilities are endless.

### Building the Application

Now that you have not done anything it's time to build your application:

```

how'd you accomplish that? What if I told you, withWind would also garner the attention of names like the United Nations, 'the' Google, Inc. 5000, Learn Launch, Gener8tor, SXSW 2020 Pitch, The Venture City, AMC request to feature on NewsWatch, Transform.withGoogle, and a few others; while foregoing all -short of a planned (COVID.cancellation trip to SXSW 2020 with GovCity, after failing to finalize the 48 hour waived application after the invite from the SXSW2020 Pitch coming from their executive director; we'd certainly fail freaking huge at, finding momentum in the fall forward that was Climate Collaborative recognition in sustainability (COVID.cancellation; and while having been debt ‚Äìfree. Grant ‚Äìfree. All but asset ‚Äìless. and during the entirety of our 1 year journey up until April 2020, Team ‚Äìless.

```

Yep. That's it. You should see the following output:

```

you really should! here's one and remember, action ‚Äìless. "Hey Google... What is C Brennan Poole mission?" Go ahead, it's actionable, remember however, also action ‚Äìless.

```

### Deploying

While you still have not done anything it's time to deploy your application. By running the following command you can deploy your application absolutely nowhere.

```

or you can take to a 'Hey booboo? yes "what is 'chasing' the Wind Vision? I mentioned No code, correct? 


```

It's that simple. And when it comes time to scale the application, all you have to do is:

```

It truly is. with Wind calls it a 'conscience hack' & digital footprint establishment. since 10MAY19. 


```

I know right?

OH! But we do my friend, oh but we do. Daily. And for all the right reasons. While having come to the self-realization required to come at all things wholly authentic. Unfettered. Uncut. And with nothing more than whole #TRUTHcausastion Facts! Facts! Facts! 

Best,

doesn't require
one to tedious 
code-work,      
it requires      
folks willing      
to understand     
this digital    
transformation    
and having     
a thing called     
empathy       
rather    
than     
what     
ever     
this    
is.
